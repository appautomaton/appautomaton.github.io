# Codex CLI setup

This runbook installs skills from this repo into Codex CLI. Execute it literally: every step states the command to run and the result to expect. Replace `<skill-name>` with one of `collaborating-with-claude`, `collaborating-with-grok`, `collaborating-with-antigravity`, or `issue-driven-workflow`. Skip `collaborating-with-codex` on Codex hosts in most cases, because Codex delegating to Codex rarely adds value.

## 1. Prerequisites

- `git` and `python3` (3.9 or newer) on PATH.
- Codex CLI installed and signed in (`codex login`).
- For each bridge skill, the child CLI it delegates to must be installed and authenticated: `claude` for collaborating-with-claude (run `claude` then `/login`, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), `grok` for collaborating-with-grok, `agy` for collaborating-with-antigravity.
- `issue-driven-workflow` needs only `python3`.

## 2. Install

Clone once, then install each skill you want. Copy for a stable install, or symlink to track your clone.

Global install, available in every project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/appautomaton/agent-designer.git ~/src/agent-designer
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R ~/src/agent-designer/skills/<skill-name> ~/.codex/skills/
rm -rf ~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/__pycache__
```

Symlink variant, where `git pull` in the clone updates the install:

```bash
ln -s ~/src/agent-designer/skills/<skill-name> ~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>
```

Project install, committed with the project and shared with teammates:

```bash
mkdir -p <project>/.codex/skills
cp -R ~/src/agent-designer/skills/<skill-name> <project>/.codex/skills/
rm -rf <project>/.codex/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/__pycache__
```

## 3. Approve

Codex has no settings allowlist equivalent to Claude Code's `permissions.allow`, so two gates matter instead.

- Approval gate: `codex exec` is non-interactive, and nothing can be approved mid-run. A gated bridge call fails on the spot rather than prompting. In interactive sessions, approve the escalation when Codex asks. In `codex exec` runs, grant what the call needs up front.
- Sandbox gate: both `read-only` and `workspace-write` block shell network, and every child CLI needs API network to reach its backend. Grant shell network to the session that runs bridges:

  ```bash
  codex --sandbox workspace-write -c 'sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true'
  ```

  Expected: bridge calls inside that session reach the child CLI's API. In an externally sandboxed environment, `--sandbox danger-full-access` also works.

For collaborating-with-claude specifically: the child `claude` must be signed in before the first bridge call. The `--help` smoke test in Verify confirms the wiring without any network grant.

## 4. Verify

1. Confirm the install location:

   ```bash
   ls ~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
   ```

   Expected: the path prints with no error.

2. Start a new Codex session and ask "what skills are available". Expected: the reply lists `<skill-name>`.

3. For a bridge skill, run its help check, for example:

   ```bash
   python3 ~/.codex/skills/collaborating-with-claude/scripts/claude_bridge.py --help
   ```

   Expected: a usage block starting with `usage: claude_bridge.py`.

## 5. Update and uninstall

- Update a copied install by re-copying from a pulled clone. A symlinked install updates with `git pull` alone.
- Uninstall by deleting the skill directory.

## What you can do now

- "Hand this refactor to Claude Code in plan mode and report its findings."
- "Have Claude Code review this diff and return a unified patch."
- "Use collaborating-with-grok to run a live X search on `<topic>` with cited URLs."
- "Ask antigravity for a second opinion on this design tradeoff."
- "Create a plan and issue CSV for `<goal>`, then execute it row by row."
